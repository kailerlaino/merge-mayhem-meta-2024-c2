# HTML Elements and Syntax

An HTML tag has 3 major components:

- **Opening Tag**: The opening tag identifies the type of HTML element. The element name between the `<>` symbols. To customize an HTML element, attributes may also be defined within the opening tags. Attributes may give the element properties that include the width, size, class or id selectors, style, etc. You can read more about various [HTML element attributes on MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes).
- **Contents**: This is the information that you want displayed. Depending on the type of elements the contents can be text that is visible to the user or other nested HTML elements for container-like elements.
- **Closing Tag**: The closing tag must be identical to the opening tab with the use of a backslash `\` symbol to denote the closing tag. It contains the name of the element between the `</>` symbols.
